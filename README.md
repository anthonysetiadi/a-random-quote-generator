# Random Quote Generator
A simple app that shows a randomly generated quote every 5 seconds or on the press of a button.

##  Description 
This is my first project I've ever coded for the purposes of the Team Treehouse Techdegree. This is also the first project to be completed for the course requirements. 

This app shows a randomly generated quote (hard coded) every 5 seconds or by pressing the button on the page. It also changes the color of background with every newly generated quote.

A live demo can be found [here](https://anthonysetiadi.github.io/a-random-quote-generator/).
